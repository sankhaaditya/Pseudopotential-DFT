# Pseudopotential-DFT
A simple real space / plane wave DFT code in Python, using ultrasoft pseudopotentials
**STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

Ultrasoft pseudopotential read in UPF format.
Libxc (http://www.tddft.org/programs/libxc/) python wrapper used for exchange-correlation potential.
Hartree potential calculated in reciprocal space.
Presently set to periodic boundary conditions.
File extraction and grid generation codes are in ./util.
Preprocessing and processing code are in ./core.
