qij divided by 4*pi*r^2

Qij multiplied by atomic fraction

What about Dij

libxc installation was a pain because of windows. need gcc compiler 64 bit, cmake. had to modify the setup.py

Installed Libxc. Basic grid mapping done. Tomorrow's objective: 1. FD, gradients, XC potential, Hartree potential. 2. Get a real test tool and make real test cases.

19-02-05
XC Potential done. Pytest, hypothesis installed. Hartree potential tomorrow

Need to go till 10 a.u. to capture wave functions. Betas, qs up to 2 a.u.
Normality checked for individual orbitals, using select betas. Orthogonality is still a confusion.
Confirmed: betas, wfs have to be divided by (r[i]*np.sqrt(4*np.pi)); qs, rho have to be divided by (4*np.pi*r[i]**2)
5.0/30 grid causing problems for betas

Grid lengths: wf goes till 10.0 au, betas till 1.5-2.0, qs till 1.5-2.0

sigma is square of the gradient.

Hartree potential is fine. Can be improved. Using frequencies -n/2 to n/2. Expand to -n to n?

Need to treat the spin polarization in Cu with correct XC functional.

spherical harmonics: theta is angle that goes around at z=0, 0 to 2pi. phi goes from top to bottom, 0 to pi.
r = np.sqrt((x-refx)**2+(y-refy)**2+(z-refz)**2)
z = r*cos(phi) --> phi = arccos(z/r)
y-yref/x-xref

overlap correctly formulated, checked. loop over l and m, double loop over energy levels.
wf and betas are not as thought before. need to be divided by only r. then multiplied by lm spherical harmonics.
confusion over vlocal, is it divided by r? appears not
checking by plugging pseudo wave functions back into ks equation
vxc and vh are generated in Hartree au, whereas pseudopotential data is in Rydberg au, 2 Ry = 1 Ha
finally the energy value is somewhat of the same order, but not right. getting -2.5, needs to be -10.
possible errors: sigma in vxc, periodic boundary condition in laplace. sure thing: vnlion

why are there only 18 electrons in cu pseudo? why does it occupy 3d84s2 and not 3d104s1?
read somewhere vxc should be 5 times less than vh. about 10 times less right now.
sigma is most probably the square of the gradient, as thought. otherwise, values are huge.
lda_xc and gga_xc functionals all giving similar values. is there something wrong with the input, nv, nc?
if 3d84s2, then there is polarization of 2.

19-03-04
sigma values confirmed to be square. for unpolarized, libxc takes arrays of length N. for polarized, rho is 2N, sigma is 3N.

19-03-06
occupancy is a confusion. some places it is a decimal e.g. Mg.
how can rho_atom be provided radially? 
trying with my calculated density instead of provided with 3d104s1. total density expression written.
total energy expression written. hartree energy and xc energy need to be corrected.
